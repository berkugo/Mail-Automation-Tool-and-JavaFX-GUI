# quick explanation

During my internship in Germany, I have managed a team as Project Manager, we have created
an application for IT department, it basically has been designed to fetch client's and customers'
data from a database named Bitrix, we have used its API to fetch data, we were executing these
JSON data to get e-mail addresses of these clients.
The main goal of the application was to send marketing e-mails to these clients from the application
and to ease sales department's work during working hours, the e-mails are being sent
automatically thanks to application.
**This mail application is running succesfully at the companies in Germany and in Malta.**

> To run the project, you have to add JavaFX as an external module from MAVEN into project.
